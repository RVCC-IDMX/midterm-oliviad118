                <h3> Beautiful coral reef</h3>
                <p>Fun facts:</p>
                <p>• Corals are animals not plants.</p>
                <p>• Coral reefs need a lot of sunlight to grow.</p>
                <p>• Too much heat can severely damage and harm them.</p>
                <p>• Coral reefs go back 240 million years. Sheesh! that's a long time.</p>
                <p>• Surprisingly they are not only found in warm water. 
                Some are found in depths as deep as 2,000 metres.</p>

            <p>Exploring was absolutely awesome. All the beautiful fishes and their habitats was so nice. 
                It really was a great experience. Definitely something I would do again.</p>

            <p>The wait time was so long and excessive especially with a young child who is eggar to get in. 
                He loved every second of his little adventure it was his first time and was so excited. 
                The smile on his face made the wait worth it in the end.</p>

            <p>Omg I walked so much I couldn't find a seat fast enough. 
                The building was so huge and had several floors. 
                Upon entering the building you start from the bottom and gradually 
                make your way to the higher levels. Its so much space to cover I kind 
                of felt like I didn't get to see everything. But the overall experience 
                was great and my favorite part was the dolphins at the end.</p>
